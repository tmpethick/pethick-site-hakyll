## Open Source

- **[Ensembled Deep Network for Global Optimization][6]**.
  This project explores the behavior of an ensembled variant of the architecture proposed by [(Snoek et al 2015)][7] on various Bayesian Optimization benchmark problems.
- **[Prolog code generation from Isabelle's inner syntax][1]**. 
  This project compiles a theorem prover written and proven with Isabelle and compiles it into Prolog. It does so in Haskell through several catamorphism that changes the Isabelle AST into a Prolog AST.
- **[CampusNet Sync][2]**. A Dropbox like inspired app to sync your computer with the filesystem used at the Technical University of Denmark.
- **[Anki Onenote importer][3]**. 
  Allows one to import `.mht` files exported from OneNote into Anki.
<!-- - Haskell Spanning Tree -->
