# Optimal Transport 

Two ways of making it computational feasable:
- Entropic Wasserstein
- Sliced Wasserstein

## Tutorial on Optimal Transport


# RL

- Linearization in RL

# Online Optimization 

I started seeing this everywhere.

Impl trick: needs to normalize with whitening (take clean samples from the dataset). E.g. Shakespeare take first part and whitening with samples from last part. 

Perturb one pixel.

Combinatorial reducing is too obvious. 

Wasserstein and value func as distribution nice.
