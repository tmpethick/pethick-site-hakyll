TODO: color primal / dual differently

-------


OMD (find good motivation - should not rely on Bregman...)

Variational inequality approach (bregman):
- generalize projected gradient descent
- Bregman divergence (here inner product comes up!)
- Inner product vs duality pairing digression (change of basis)
- Subdiff digression (with examples)
- Mirror descent / Proximal mapping (example with entropic)

- Duality
  - Derivative definition
  - Properties
  - a generalization of a geometric interpretation
- OMD ... with friends
  - How do we combine primal w/ dual objects?
  - Illustration of duality
  - State what we know about the dual space.
  - All three coincide when not constrained
- Constraint setting
  - State setting
  - Key facts
  -

- Adaptivity
  - Optimistic
