# Robustness talk

Hessian
- Only second order approx

Summary of talk:
- Decision boundary close to datapoint (surprising when two random points are far away)
- Perturbation with linearization (first-order approx iteratively)
- Subspace (space is rich)
- Universal (unknown image)
- Low curvature is necessary
