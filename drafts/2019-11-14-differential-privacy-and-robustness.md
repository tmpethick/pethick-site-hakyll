# Definition of $\epsillon$-differential privacy

Algorithm $A$ takes a dataset.
epsilon differential privacy if $D_1$ and $D_2$ differs on a single element (i.e. a person)

$$\operatorname{Pr}\left[\mathcal{A}\left(D_{1}\right) \in S\right] \leq e^{\epsilon} \times \operatorname{Pr}\left[\mathcal{A}\left(D_{2}\right) \in S\right]$$

The output of the data set

"The most widespread relaxation is (ε, δ)-differential privacy,[19] which weakens the definition by allowing an additional small δ density of probability on which the upper bound ε does not hold."

Which one is a subset of the other?
